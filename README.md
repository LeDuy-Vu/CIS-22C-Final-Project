# CIS-22C-Final-Project
This is the final project in my Data Abstraction and Structures class at De Anza College. My gratitude to teammates Chi Huynh, Ethan Ly, Angelo Rosario, and especially, our wonderful team leader Nikita Klimo for the amazing experience.<br/>
In C++, we worked together from sratch to design and develop a data storage and console frontend for a laptop shop. Both employees and customers can use the program to interact with the items on sale (laptops). The customers with their own accounts can surf through all items in the shop, sort them by various orders, see details of each item, place an order, and check order status. The employees have administrative password to the system to do their tasks such as ship an order, update stock, etc.<br/>
We implemented the simulated store with various data structures like BST, heap, hash table, linked list, and priority queues for different storing and sorting purposes. Information about items, customers, employees, and orders are saved in the text files.
