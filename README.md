# CIS-22C-Final-Project
This is the first CS team project I have ever participated in my life. It was the final project back at De Anza College in my Data Abstraction and Structures class. My gratitude to my teammates Chi Huynh, Ethan Ly, Angelo Rosario, and especially, our wonderful team leader Nikita Klimo for the amazing experience.<br/>
In C++, we worked together from sratch to design and develop a data storage and console interface for a laptop shop. Both employee and customer can use the program to interact with the items (laptops). The customers with their own accounts can surf through all items in the shop, sort them by various orders, see detail of each item, place an order, and check order status. The employees also have administrative password to the system to do their tasks such as send an order, update stock, etc.<br/>
We implemented the simulated store with various data structures like BST, heap, hash table, linked list, and priority queues for different storing and sorting purposes. Information about items, customers, employees, and orders are saved in the file system.
